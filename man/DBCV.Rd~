\title{
Double Bounded Contingent Valuation 
}

\description{
The function DBCV estimates coefficients from a double-bounded contingent valuation survey. It basically is a bivariat probit regression with the restriction that all the coefficients of both questions are identical.
}

\usage{
DBCV(x, ...)
\method{DBCV}{default}(x,y,z, data, method,...)
\method{DBCV}{formula}(formula, data=list(), initpar=NULL, method="Newton-Raphson", ...)
\method{summary}{DBCV}(object, ...)
\method{print}{DBCV}(x, ...)
\method{print}{summary.DBCV}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
  
  \item{y}{a matrix with two columns. The first column is 1 of the first question was answered with 'yes' and and 0 if it was answered with 'no'. The second column is 1 of the second question was answered with 'yes' and and 0 if it was answered with 'no'.}
  \item{x}{a matrix with two columns. The first column is the offerd bid in the first question, the second column is the offered bid in the second question.}
  \item{z}{additional, subject specific, explaining variables}
  \item{formula}{a symbolic description of the model to estimat. See details below.}
  \item{data}{an otional data fram containing the varaibles in the model.}
  \item{initpar}{a vector of inital parameters for logLik() function from the logLik-package. If NULL, the initial values are estimated with the glm() function from the stats-package with the second answer as dependent variable and the second bid offered as bid variable.}
  \item{method}{a character determining the optimization method in the function logLik(). If NULL, "Newton-Raphson" method is used. For alternatives and details see the documentation of logLik()}
  \item{object}{an object of class \code{"DBCV"}, i.e., a fitted model}
  \item{\dots}{
   currently not used 
  }
}
\details{
The formula must be given in the followin form:
\deqn{yes1 + yes2 ~ bid1 + bid2 | z1 + z2 + ... + zn}
where yes1 and yes2 are the reply to the first and the second question. These numeric variables are 1 if the subject answered 'yes' and 0 if the subject answered 'no'. 'bid1' and 'bid2' are numeric variables which provide the first and the second bid offered to the subject. For subjects which answered 'yes' to the first bid, \eqn{bid1<bid2}. for subjects which answered 'no' to the first bid, \eqn{bid1>bid2}. z1 to zn are addtional explaining, subject specific variables. 
 
For identification the standard error sigma is set to 1.

}
\value{An object of class \code{"DBCV"}, basically a list containing
  \item{coefficients}{a named vector of coefficients}
  \item{vcov}{covariance matrix of coefficients}
  \item{LogLik}{log-likelihood value}
  \item{df}{Degrees of freedom}
  \item{data}{data used to estimate the function}
